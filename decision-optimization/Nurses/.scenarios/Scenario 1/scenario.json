It takes into account specific scenarios, resources, and knowledge of past and current events. With this insight, your organization can make better decisions and have greater control of business outcomes.  \\r\\n#dd-markdown \\r\\n#dd-markdown * Prescriptive analytics is the next step on the path to insight-based actions. It creates value through synergy with predictive analytics, which analyzes data to predict future outcomes.  \\r\\n#dd-markdown \\r\\n#dd-markdown * Prescriptive analytics takes that insight to the next level by suggesting the optimal way to handle that future situation. Organizations that can act fast in dynamic conditions and make superior decisions in uncertain environments gain a strong competitive advantage.  \\r\\n#dd-markdown <br/>\\r\\n#dd-markdown \\r\\n#dd-markdown <u>With prescriptive analytics, you can:</u> \\r\\n#dd-markdown \\r\\n#dd-markdown * Automate the complex decisions and trade-offs to better manage your limited resources.\\r\\n#dd-markdown * Take advantage of a future opportunity or mitigate a future risk.\\r\\n#dd-markdown * Proactively update recommendations based on changing events.\\r\\n#dd-markdown * Meet operational goals, increase customer loyalty, prevent threats and fraud, and optimize business processes.\\r\\n#dd-markdown ## Checking minimum requirements\\r\\n#dd-markdown This notebook uses some features of pandas that are available in version 0.17.1 or above.\\r\\n#dd-cell\\r\\nimport pip\\r\\nREQUIRED_MINIMUM_PANDAS_VERSION = '0.17.1'\\r\\ntry:\\r\\n    import pandas as pd\\r\\n    assert pd.__version__ >= REQUIRED_MINIMUM_PANDAS_VERSION\\r\\nexcept:\\r\\n    raise Exception(\\\"Version %s or above of Pandas is required to run this notebook\\\" % REQUIRED_MINIMUM_PANDAS_VERSION)\\r\\n#dd-markdown ### Step 2: Set up the prescriptive engine\\r\\n#dd-markdown \\r\\n#dd-markdown * Subscribe to our private cloud offer or Decision Optimization on Cloud solve service [here](https://developer.ibm.com/docloud) if you do not want to use a local solver.\\r\\n#dd-markdown * Get the service URL and your personal API key and enter your credentials here if accurate:\\r\\n#dd-cell\\r\\n# @hidden_cell\\r\\nurl = \\\"https://api-oaas.docloud.ibmcloud.com/job_manager/rest/v1/\\\"\\r\\nkey = \\\"api_f550300e-8e52-4f3e-abf1-0fe1ac428d93\\\"\\r\\n#dd-markdown ### Step 3: Model the data\\r\\n#dd-markdown \\r\\n#dd-markdown The input data consists of several tables:\\r\\n#dd-markdown \\r\\n#dd-markdown * The Departments table lists all departments in the scope of the assignment.\\r\\n#dd-markdown * The Skills table list all skills.\\r\\n#dd-markdown * The Shifts table lists all shifts to be staffed.

The result is stored in a new column `wstart`.\\r\\n#dd-cell\\r\\ndf_shifts[\\\"wstart\\\"] = df_shifts.start_time + 24 * df_shifts.dow\\r\\n#dd-markdown #### Sub-Step #3 : Compute the absolute end time of each shift.\\r\\n#dd-markdown \\r\\n#dd-markdown Computing the absolute end time is a little more complicated as certain shifts span across midnight. For example, Shift #3 starts on Monday at 18:00 and ends Tuesday at 2:00 AM. The absolute end time of Shift #3 is 26, not 2.\\r\\n#dd-markdown The general rule for computing absolute end time is:\\r\\n#dd-markdown \\r\\n#dd-markdown `abs_end_time = end_time + 24 * dow + (start_time>= end_time ? 24 : 0)`\\r\\n#dd-markdown \\r\\n#dd-markdown Again, we use *pandas* to add a new calculated column `wend`. This is done by using the *pandas* `apply` method with an anonymous `lambda` function over rows. The `raw=True` parameter prevents the creation of a *pandas* Series for each row, which improves the performance significantly on large data sets.\\r\\n#dd-cell\\r\\n# an auxiliary function to calculate absolute end time of a shift\\r\\ndef calculate_absolute_endtime(start, end, dow):\\r\\n    return 24*dow + end + (24 if start>=end else 0)\\r\\n\\r\\n# store the results in a new column\\r\\ndf_shifts[\\\"wend\\\"] = df_shifts.apply(lambda row: calculate_absolute_endtime(\\r\\n        row.start_time, row.end_time, row.dow), axis=1, raw=True)\\r\\n#dd-markdown #### Sub-step #4 : Compute the duration of each shift.\\r\\n#dd-markdown \\r\\n#dd-markdown Computing the duration of each shift is now a straightforward difference of columns. The result is stored in column `duration`.\\r\\n#dd-cell\\r\\ndf_shifts[\\\"duration\\\"] = df_shifts.wend - df_shifts.wstart\\r\\n#dd-markdown #### Sub-step #5 : Compute the minimum demand for each shift.\\r\\n#dd-markdown \\r\\n#dd-markdown Minimum demand is the product of duration (in hours) by the minimum required number of nurses. Thus, in number of \\r\\n#dd-markdown nurse-hours, this demand is stored in another new column `min_demand`.\\r\\n#dd-markdown \\r\\n#dd-markdown Finally, we display the updated shifts DataFrame with all calculated columns.\\r\\n#dd-cell\\r\\n# also compute minimum demand in nurse-hours\\r\\ndf_shifts[\\\"min_demand\\\"] = df_shifts.min_req * df_shifts.duration\\r\\n\\r\\n# finally check the modified shifts dataframe\\r\\ndf_shifts\\r\\n#dd-markdown ### Step 5: Set up the prescriptive model\\r\\n#dd-cell\\r\\nfrom docplex.mp.environment import Environment\\r\\nenv = Environment()\\r\\nenv.print_information()\\r\\n#dd-markdown #### Create the DOcplex model\\r\\n#dd-markdown The model contains all the business constraints and defines the objective.\\r\\n#dd-markdown \\r\\n#dd-markdown We now use CPLEX Modeling for Python to build a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) model for this problem.\\r\\n#dd-cell\\r\\nfrom docplex.mp.model import Model\\r\\nmdl = Model(name=\\\"nurses\\\")\\r\\n#dd-markdown #### Define the decision variables\\r\\n#dd-markdown \\r\\n#dd-markdown For each (nurse, shift) pair, we create one binary variable that is equal to 1 when the nurse is assigned to the shift.\\r\\n#dd-markdown \\r\\n#dd-markdown We use the `binary_var_matrix` method of class `Model`, as each binary variable is indexed by _two_ objects: one nurse and one shift.\\r\\n#dd-cell\\r\\n# first global collections to iterate upon\\r\\nall_nurses = df_nurses.index.values\\r\\nall_shifts = df_shifts.index.values\\r\\n\\r\\n# the assignment variables.\\r\\ndef make_shift_name(shift_idx):\\r\\n    shift_row = df_shifts.iloc[shift_idx]\\r\\n    # keep first 3 characters in departement, uppercased\\r\\n    dept2 = shift_row.department[0:4].upper()\\r\\n    # keep 3 days of weekday\\r\\n    dayname = shift_row.day[0:3].lower()\\r\\n    return '%s_%s_%02d' % (dept2, dayname, shift_row.start_time)\\r\\n\\r\\n# the assignment variables.\\r\\nassigned = mdl.binary_var_matrix(keys1=all_nurses, keys2=all_shifts, name=lambda ns: \\\"NurseAssigned_%s_%s\\\" % (ns[0], make_shift_name(ns[1])))\\r\\n#dd-markdown #### Express the business constraints\\r\\n#dd-markdown \\r\\n#dd-markdown #####  Overlapping shifts\\r\\n#dd-markdown \\r\\n#dd-markdown Some shifts overlap in time, and thus cannot be assigned to the same nurse.\\r\\n#dd-markdown To check whether two shifts overlap in time, we start by ordering all shifts with respect to their *wstart* and *duration* properties. Then, for each shift, we iterate over the subsequent shifts in this ordered list to easily compute the subset of overlapping shifts.\\r\\n#dd-markdown \\r\\n#dd-markdown We use *pandas* operations to implement this algorithm. But first, we organize all decision variables in a DataFrame.\\r\\n#dd-markdown \\r\\n#dd-markdown For convenience, we also organize the decision variables in a pivot table with *nurses* as row index and *shifts* as columns.
